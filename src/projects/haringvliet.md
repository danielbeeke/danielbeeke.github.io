A dozen of organisations from the Netherlands have bundled forces to advance and develop a region. This region has a lot of beautiful nature.

Our task was to create a news / blog website with an interactive map.

We did this in three iterations.

- We built the website with news, blogs and some project information.
- Then we built a first version of the map, with a map drawn by an illustrator.
- Then we made the map as shown in this showcase.
