Together with Robin de Vos I created this app. He worked on the contents and the idea and I did the application. It is an app where you can select some moments on the day that you want to pray. On these moments it will give you a prayer from categories that you can select. 

This app tries to be between a static prayerbook and a freeform prayer where you have no guidance. You can select categories that you like and also give them a certain order.
