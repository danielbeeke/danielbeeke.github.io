BibLogos helps groups of people to collectively work on distilling facts out of books and provide that as a dataset.

It does this by a process where everybody can create book markings with meaning and ask for their work to be integrated into a dataset. Those markings are then provided as RDF data with references back to the source book.

The primary focus for this software is the bible. In time, you can find answers to questions like:
- In which cities did Jesus heal the sick
- What are the alternative names of Jesus
- Which parables do exist
