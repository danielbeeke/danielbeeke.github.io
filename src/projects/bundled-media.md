Imagine you want to find great Christian media, where do you start?

Bundled.media is a project to bundle Christian media together in one Open Source code base. Each media publisher can add their interegration code, a code review will be made and after that a new release of bundled.media will be ready. 

Organizations should slef host their instance, this mkaes sure cost is at the place of the cost bringer, it also protects license rights as some media publishers require access keys.

Bundled.media does not have a database, it normalizes data on the fly. It makes it possible to search through all the sources at once.

When a lot of the medium to big sized Christian media publishers are on board the project might be open sourced.
