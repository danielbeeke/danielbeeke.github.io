![Daniel Beeke](/assets/daniel.jpeg) From a young age I have always been interested in technology and creating things. Over the years this interest particularly grew in the area of software development. I have been doing that professionally for 15 years now.

### Current work

My job involves [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework), [Deno](https://deno.land/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and a lot of media. It is for [Operation Mobilisation](https://om.org). I am also available for small sized contract jobs and Open Source work.

### Previous work

Before this, I have worked at the hosting company [Fundaments](https://fundaments.nl/), rewriting the backbone for their engineers and customers. Other previous jobs are: almost 5 year as a lead developer with a Drupal agency, where we created medium to big sized applications and 2 years at another Drupal agency.

### A system thinker and always learning

I am a system thinker and I get enthusiastic of exploring possible solutions with the customer / product owner. Things that I love: working together, coaching and learning from and with colleagues.

I regularly give meetup talks about javascript things and have given talks about Drupal in the past. 

Most of the time I have a side project running. I always love learning something new.

I like philosophy and the intersections of philosophy with the technical world, ethics and other things that are suitable for good talks with fine company.
