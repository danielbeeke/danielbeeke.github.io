I am doing Open Source work in the area of RDF. I have done two bounties for [Comunica](https://comunica.dev/association/bounties/#completed). I would love to do more work in this area. If you have RDF related Open Source work and you want to sponsor me, please contact me. 

I am also working on some libraries that I created:

Would you like to see these libraries improved? Consider sponsoring so that I have more hours available to work on these libaries.

Do you have other libraries that you would like to see improved? Please contact me and we will have a chat to see if it is a match.
