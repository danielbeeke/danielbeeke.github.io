You can sponsor me so that I can do more Open Source work. 

It is also possible to make known which issues you want to see solved. <br>
Contact me for requests.

### I am open to the following Open Source work:

- RDF focused Open Source libaries
- Maintain my own RDF focused libraries
- Libraries in other areas (have a chat and we'll see if I could do it)
